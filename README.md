# **Vision-Transformer-Based-Image-Classification**

## Overview
**VisionX** is a Python-based image classification project utilizing Vision Transformers (ViT) from Hugging Face and PyTorch. This project demonstrates how state-of-the-art transformer models can classify images with high accuracy. The model is deployed as an API, allowing users to upload images and receive predictions.

## Features
- Image classification using Vision Transformers.
- Built with PyTorch and Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- API integration for real-time image classification.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/VisionX.git
    cd VisionX
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

### API Key Setup
This project requires an API key for authentication with external services or APIs. Follow these steps to generate and use the API key:

#### Step 1: Generate Your API Key
1. Visit the [API provider's website](https://api-ninjas.com/api/nutrition) to create an account.
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your account settings.
3. Click on **Generate New Key** and copy the generated key.

#### Step 2: Set the API Key in Your Environment
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you generated:
    ```bash
    API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

3. The app will automatically load this key from the environment when running.

## Usage

1. **Run the API:**
    Once the setup is complete, you can start the API by running the `app.py` script.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Making a request:**
    You can send an image file to the API and receive classification results. Below is an example using `curl`:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -F "file=@path/to/image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict
    ```

3. **Response:**
    The API will return a JSON object with the predicted class and confidence score.
